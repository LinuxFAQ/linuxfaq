# Contributing

## Welcome

Hello, looks like you're interested in helping the Linux community by contributing a new solution!

First, there are some things you should do to make sure your solution gets accepted!

1) Make sure there are no duplicate questions! Duplicate questions only lead to confusion.
2) Ensure your solution is concise and to the point!
3) Avoid picture / video guides. You should be aiming for making a detailed guide, as if you were explaining step by step to somebody. Media shouldn't be essential, it should be additional.
4) Format your markdown properly.
5) Avoid advertising if possible. Prioritize common solutions over FOSS solutions, then FOSS solutions over proprietary or paid solutions.
6) Keep it professional. No swear words.
7) Use common English only. No overabundance of complicated terminology. Non-English solutions will not be accepted in this repository.
8) No copyrighted material. All contributed material will be assumed to comply with the GPLv3.0 License. The exception is 3rd party linking, such as using an image hosted on a permitted website.

## Formatting

When formatting your Markdown, here are some quick tips:

- Your file name should be formatted with lower_snake_case. Example: `how_to_create_http_server.md`.
- Your file should begin with a large header (sized \<h1\>). Example: `# How to create an HTTP server`.
- Sections should be labeled with a medium header (sized \<h2\>) Example: `## How to start an HTTP server`.
- Subsections should be labeled with a small header (sized \<h3\>) Example: `### Starting an HTTP server`.
- Do NOT use bolded text as replacements for headers.
- Headers should not be smaller than a small header (sized \<h3\>).
- Do NOT use any HTML tags.

## Submitting contributions

Contributions should be submitted via a Pull Request. Maintainers will verify that your submission is compliant.

## Regarding Issues

Issues are for Bug Reports / Security Vulnerabilities / Feature Requests ONLY.

If you contributed something and don't see immediate changes on the reflected websites, just wait! It depends on the server configuration as far as how long it will take to sync with the local repository.
